\subsection{Resources}

The Center for Atmospheric Chemistry (CAC) already has access to proprietary software which is required to compile the GEOS-Chem model, which is itself open source.
CAC has access to the University of Wollongong's high performance computing servers as well as the The National Computational Infrastructure, both of which allow high demand computational tasks such as running and developing GEOS-Chem.
