\section{PHD Proposal}

\subsection{Improved Modelling resolution}
Higher resolution modelling over Australia will allow for improved validation with in situ measurements, as well as regional and city scale simulation analysis. 
Dust simulation in particular can be greatly improved with finer surface wind resolution and will be one of the areas I will focus on with validation against both in situ and satellite measurements of AOD and dust concentrations across Australia.
One of my goals for my PHD will be to improve the GEOS-Chem model by setting up meteorological fields with higher horizontal resolution over Australia and NZ.
This has been done already over China, North America, and Europe (\cite{Chen_2009}, 2 more cites needed) but not for anywhere in the southern hemisphere.

\subsection{Ozone intrusions}

\subsection{Isoprene and VOCs}
Another source(the main source) of ozone in the lower troposphere is chemical formation following emissions of precursor gases, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene, and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

\subsection{Dust emission and deposition validation}
Notes from Paper and validation of GOES dust simulation?
