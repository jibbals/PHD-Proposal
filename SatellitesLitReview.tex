\subsection{Satellites looking at trace gasses}
Several satellites provide long term trace gas data with near complete global coverage. 
These provide column ozone concentrations using satellite spectrometers and following is a description of some of these instruments.

These satellites are on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) trajectories and overpass any area up to once per day. 
They record near nadir reflected spectra between around 250-700~nm in order to calculate trace gasses including O$_3$, NO$_2$, BrO, SO$_2$, and HCHO.
