Satellites can use  Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscop (DOAS) techniques with radiative transfer calculations on solar radiation absorption spectra to measure trace gases in vertical columns.
DOAS is based on Beer's law relating the attenuation of light to the properties of the medium it travels through. 
$$ I = I_0 \exp \left( \Sigma_i \int \rho_i \beta_i ds \right) $$
Where I is radiation intensity, \rho is a species density, and \beta is the scattering and absorption cross section area.
The formula actually used by satellites involves further functions representing scattering efficiency and extinction by Mie and Rayleigh scattering.
Calculations of slant columns and 'air mass factors' is required to determine the effect of the non strict path of light measured by the instrument.
