\subsection{Isoprene and formaldehyde (HCHO)}
\label{proxy}
Methane and isoprene each comprise around a third of the yearly global total emission of VOCs.
However, methane is relatively long lived (years) and is well mixed in the atmosphere while isoprene levels are very volatile and spatially diverse due to a life time of around an hour. Estimates put global isoprene emission at roughly 550 Tg yr$^{âˆ’1}$ \cite{Guenther_2006,Monks_2014}, emitted mostly by trees and shrubs during the day.
Isoprene is hard to measure directly due to its short lifetime and weak spectral absorption, instead formaldehyde (HCHO) is often used as a proxy \cite{Marais_2012,bauwens2013satellite}.

Biogenic isoprene emissions are far greater than anthropogenic emissions of VOCs \cite{Guenther_2006}. 
The lack of accuracy in BVOC emissions estimates has a large effect on determining with confidence the sources and distribution of pollutants including ozone and organic aerosols.
Accuracy in VOC measurements is important: it has been shown that even the diurnal pattern of isoprene emissions has an effect on modelling ground level ozone \cite{Hewitt_2011,Fan_2004}.
These uncertainties could explain why models of HCHO over Australia are poor at reproducing satellite measurements \cite{Stavrakou_2008}.

A widely used estimate of global isoprene emissions is the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). MEGAN uses leaf area index, forest canopy modelling, and plant functional type emission factors to simulate terrestrial isoprene emissions.
Emission factors represent quantities of a pollutant released to the atmosphere through an associated activity.
For example, an emission factor for isoprene within a forest would include the requirement of sunshine and suitable temperature.
\citet{Guenther_2006} estimates that the Australian outback is among the worlds strongest isoprene sources with forests in SE Australia having emission factors greater than 16 mg m$^{-2}$ h$^{-1}$ (see figure \ref{fig:meganisoprene}).

These emissions factor estimates are not well verified as there is little coverage of isoprene (or other BVOC) emissions measurements over Australia. However, comprehensive coverage of one of the products of isoprene chemistry in the atmosphere over Australia exists in the form of satellite measurements. 
Satellites recording reflected solar spectra use Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) to measure various trace gases in the atmosphere, including formaldehyde (HCHO). HCHO production in the continental boundary layer is generally dominated by isoprene emissions \cite{Kefauver_2014}.
Using satellite data from 2004 (see section \ref{satellites}) we have a broad measure of seasonal and interannual variability of HCHO over Australia. These records can be compared with modeled estimates of HCHO and used as a proxy to estimate isoprene emissions. This has been done in North America, South America, and Africa, with satellite and aircraft data combined for validation \cite{Millet_2006, Marais_2014}.

The methodology for calculating VOCs from HCHO is laid out in Palmer et al. (2003), and takes into account the expected lifetime and reaction rates of the precursor VOCs and HCHO.
Assuming HCHO is produced quickly from short-lived intermediates we get
\begin{eqnarray*}
VOC_i \overset{k_i}{\rightarrow} Y_i HCHO
\end{eqnarray*}
Where $Y_i$ is HCHO yield per C atom.
Then assuming a steady state of atmospheric HCHO ($\Omega$ molecules $cm^{-2}$) produced by oxidation of VOCs (VOC$_i$) and no horizontal transport:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Omega = \frac{1}{k_{HCHO}} \sum_{i} Y_i E_i
\end{eqnarray*}
Where i indexes a chemical species, and $E_i$ is emission fluxes ( C atoms $cm^{-2}s^{-1}$).

Inferring the VOC emissions then requires estimates of the HCHO yield (Y$_i$) which can be attained via modelling as layed out in \citet{Millet_2006}.

During low NO$_X$ conditions, the precursor HCHO has a longer lifetime (days).
This allows horizontal transport to occur and complicates the algorithms.
Horizontal transport 'smears' the HCHO signal so that source location would need to be calculated using windspeeds and loss rates.
In high NOx environments where HCHO has a lifetime on the order of 30 minutes HCHO can be used to map isoprene emissions with spatial resolution from 10-100 kms.
For conditions where VOCs have a lifetime of days determining the major HCHO contributors requires a complex inversion to map HCHO columns to VOC emissions.
