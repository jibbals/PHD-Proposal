\subsection{Aims}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determining the impact and causes of stratosphere to tropopause ozone transport (STT) using ozonesones and ECMWF weather reanalysis data.
\item Quantify Australian isoprene emissions using satellite data and the GEOS-Chem model. 
\item Attribute Australian ozone influence from isoprene, NOx, and STT sources over particular sites using ozonesondes and modelled data.
\item Improve the GEOS-Chem model by allowing increased resolution over Australia, using a nested grid within the global model to allow high resolution output without severely impacting run time.
\item Examine Australias impact on primary production and aerosol pollution through an analysis of dust emissions and transport modelled by GEOS-Chem and validated against in-situ data from CoDii and AERONET sites.
