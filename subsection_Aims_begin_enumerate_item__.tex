\subsection{Aims}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To determine the impact and causes of stratosphere to troposphere ozone transport (STT) using ozonesones and ECMWF weather reanalysis data.
\item To quantify Australian isoprene emissions using satellite data and the GEOS-Chem model. 
\item To attribute Australian ozone influence from isoprene, and STT sources over particular sites using in-situ data and model output.
\item To improve the GEOS-Chem model by allowing increased resolution over Australia.
\item To quantify Australia's dust emissions and transport modelled by GEOS-Chem and validate against in-situ and remote sensing data.
\end{enumerate}
