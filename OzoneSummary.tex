\subsection{Ozone Summary}
Ozone in the lower atmosphere is a serious hazard that causes health problems \cite{Hsieh_2013}, damages agricultural crops worth billions of dollar \cite{Avnery_2011}, and increases the rate of climate warming \cite{IPCC_2013_chap8}.
  
Photochemical oxidation of CO, CH4, and NMVOCs while NOx is present, as well as downward stratospheric transport, are the two main sources of surface ozone \cite{Mahajan_2015}.
