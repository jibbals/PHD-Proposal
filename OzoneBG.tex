\subsection{Tropospheric ozone}

Ozone is a toxic trace gas which increases mortality rates when populations are exposed for extended periods of time.
The amount of global premature deaths per year due to atmospheric ozone exposure has recently been estimated at $\sim$150-470 thousand \cite{Silva_2013, Lelieveld_2015}.
Long term effects of ozone overexposure increase the risk of respiratory disease and may also increase other cardiopulmonary risks \cite{Jerrett_2009}.

The Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) National Environment Protection Measure (NEPM), which is the Australian framework for air quality measurement and reporting aiming for ``adequate protection of human health and well-being'' has set national standards and benchmarks for reporting. The NEPM covers six chemical groups including Ozone (O$_3$), and the benchmarks are shown in figure \ref{fig:nepm}.

The primary source of ozone in the lower troposphere is chemical formation following emissions of precursor gases, including VOCs, and NO$_X$.
Globally the greatest sources of NO$_X$ include fossil fuel combustion ($\sim$50\%), biomass burning ($\sim$20\%), lightning, and microbial activity in soils \citep{Delmas_1997}.
Estimates using a global CTM (CHASER) constrained by measurements from two satellites as well as the in-situ measurements taken through LIDAR and aircraft (INTEX-B) put global tropospheric NO$_X$ emissions at 45.4 TgN yr$^{-1}$ in 2005 \cite{Miyazaki_2011}.

Primarily chemical formation is due to photochemical oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH$_4$), and other Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOCs) in the presence of nitrous oxides (NO$_X$ $\equiv$ NO $+$ NO$_2$) \cite{Stevenson_2006}.

While photochemical production is the dominant source, stratosphere to troposphere transport (STT) of ozone is also important and climate change may drastically increase this quantity \cite{Hegglin_2009}.
Ozone-rich air mixes irreversibly down from the stratosphere during certain meteorological conditions \citep{Sprenger2003,Mihalikova2012}.
In the extra-tropics, STTs most commonly occur during synoptic-scale tropopause folds \citep{Sprenger2003} and are characterised by tongues of high Potential Vorticity (PV) air descending to low altitudes.
PV is a metric which can be used to determine whether a parcel of air is stratospheric, based on its local rotation and stratification.
These tongues become elongated and filaments separate from the tongue which mix into tropospheric air.
Stratospheric ozone brought deeper (lower) into the troposphere is more likely to affect the surface ozone budget and tropospheric chemistry \citep{Zanis2003,Langford_2009}.

Photolysis of NO$_2$ forms NO + O(3P), which combines with O$_2$ to form O$_3$, leading to reaction with NO to form NO$_2$ + O$_2$.
These reactions reach a steady state where O$_3$ is proportional to the ratio between NO$_2$ and NO \cite{Sillman_2002}.
The following formulae show an example of this with CO, however, similar reactions occur for many VOCs:
\begin{eqnarray*}
NO_2 + hv &\overset{k_1}{\rightarrow}& NO + O({}^3 P) \\
O({}^3 P) + O_2 &\overset{M}{\rightarrow}& O_3 \\
NO + O_3 &\overset{k_2}{\rightarrow}& NO_2 + O_2 \\
\left[O_3\right] &\sim& \frac{k_1}{k_2} \frac{\left[NO_2\right]}{\left[NO\right]} \\
OH + CO &{\rightarrow}& HOCO \\
HOCO + O_2 &{\rightarrow}& HO_2 + CO_2 \\
HO_2 + NO &{\rightarrow}& OH + NO_2 \\
\end{eqnarray*}
where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are reaction rates.
The balance of these reactions is:
\begin{eqnarray*} CO + 2O_2 + hv {\rightarrow} CO_2 + O_3 \end{eqnarray*}
Note that hv represents photons, and this reaction pathway only occurs during the day.

VOCs affect the NO$_2$ to NO ratio which changes the equilibrium and can increase O$_3$ creation.
One dominant precursor to ozone is isoprene (C$_5$H$_8$), which in the atmosphere reacts rapidly with hydroxyl radicals (OH) to form peroxy radicals (RO$_2$).
These react with nitrogen oxides and can lead to ground-level ozone formation similarly to the CO reaction listed prior.

Together formaldehyde (HCHO) and NO$_2$ regulate tropospheric oxidation capacity through O$_3$ production, as well as being health hazards.
The HCHO/NO$_2$ ratio can be used to determine whether surface O$_3$ is NO$_2$ or VOC limited \cite{Mahajan_2015}.
If O$_3$ is NO$_2$ limited then an increase in NO$_2$ will increase O$_3$ levels while an increase in HCHO will not, and vice versa when O$_3$ is HCHO limited.
NO$_2$ is a common pollutant in populated areas, released primarily by combustion in power generation and transport. 
In Australia VOCs and NOx are largely emitted from biogenic sources, although lightning, and biomass burning (most clearly in the Northern Territory) also play a role \cite{Guenther_2006, VanDerA_2008}.

The amounts of tropospheric ozone from STTs and photochemical production are estimated to be around 550 and 5100 Tg yr$^{-1}$, respectively. 
The main ozone removal processes are chemical destruction and dry deposition, respectively removing 4650, 1000 Tg yr$^{-1}$ from the the troposphere \cite{Stevenson_2006}.
