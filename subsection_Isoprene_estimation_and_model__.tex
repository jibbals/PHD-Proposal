\subsection{Isoprene estimation and model validation over Australia}

\subsubsection{Preliminary Results}

Satellite HCHO data is downloaded with some preliminary analysis done to verify the integrity of the data.
SCIAMACHY suffers from poor measurements when south of 30$^{\circ}$S and is not reliable for our purposes, however GOME-2 records cover Australia completely. 

A sample of the satellite's HCHO record is shown in figure \ref{fig:hchomonth}
