\subsection{Isoprene estimation and model validation over Australia}

\subsubsection{Preliminary Results}

Satellite HCHO data is downloaded with some preliminary analysis done to verify the integrity of the data.
SCIAMACHY suffers from poor measurements when south of 30$^{\circle}$S and is not reliable for our purposes, however GOME-2 records cover Australia completely. 
(TODO: HCHO scripts?!)
