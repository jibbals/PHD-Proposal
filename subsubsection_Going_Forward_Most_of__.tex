\subsubsection{STT Discussion}

Most of the analysis for this work has been completed, with a couple of issues to explain before being published to ACP.
Foreign and local influence of transported pollution or smoke plumes needs to be discussed, as well as the reversibility of the STT events.

Some work has been done on long range influence of pollution from the tropics over southern mid-latitudes starting with \citet{Pak_2003}. The impacts should be relatively small, especially over Macquarie and Davis which are at high southern latitudes.

Using local weather patterns from ERAI we can infer that most of our detected ozone events are occurring during conditions conducive to irreversible transport. Further analysis of the weather data may be warranted however it will remain to be done outside of this project.

This work will also be useful in extra analysis and validation of the GEOS-Chem simulation of ozone over Australia and the near southern ocean.
