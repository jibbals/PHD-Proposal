Satellites can use  Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscop (DOAS) techniques with radiative transfer calculations on solar radiation absorption spectra to measure trace gases in vertical columns.
DOAS is based on Beer's law relating the attenuation of light to the properties of the medium it travels through. 
$$ I = I_0 exp ( \Sigma_i \int \rho_i \beta_i ds ) $$
