\subsection{Ozone and Isoprene Summary}
Ozone in the lower atmosphere is a serious hazard that causes health problems \cite{Hsieh_2013}, damages agricultural crops worth billions of dollar \cite{Avnery_2011}, and increases the rate of climate warming \cite{IPCC_2013_chap8}.
  
Photochemical oxidation of CO, CH4, and NMVOCs while NOx is present, as well as downward stratospheric transport, are the two main sources of surface ozone \cite{Mahajan_2015}.

The main NMVOC is isoprene(source?) which is hard to directly measure, instead formaldehyde is often used as a proxy \cite{Marais_2012}(TODO: more sources?). 
Satellites can use DOAS analysis methods on solar radiation absorption spectra to measure column HCHO.
Several satellite data sets are publicly available and have been used to show increasing HCHO trends in developing countries \cite{Mahajan_2015}.
