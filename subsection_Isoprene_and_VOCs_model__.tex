\subsection{Isoprene and VOCs model validation over Australia}
\subsubsection{Preliminary Results}

Satellite HCHO measurements exist since 2004 (OMI) and 2006 (GOME2), and the ground based measurements over Wollongong exist since 1996. 
These data have already been downloaded and preliminarily examined.


\subsubsection{Going Forward}
While the ground based data is spatially sparse it can be used as validation of models and satellite data. 
Combining the long record of measurements from Wollongong with the decadal-scale satellite data and chemical transport modelling in this PhD project will allow the first large-scale quantification of isoprene measurements in Australia, paving the way for more accurate ozone projections.
