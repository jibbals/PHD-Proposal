\subsubsection{Going Forward}

This work has been presented as a poster at the 7th international GEOS-Chem meeting (IGC7).
With improved model resolution (see section \ref{resolutionwork}) it is expected that dust emission accuracy will improve.
A comparison against satellite AOD may be undertaken.
Similarly to AERONET, satellite AOD represents column totals and may be a more apt source of model verification.

An analysis of possible meteorological drivers of dust export will also be undertaken.

If improvements to the model can be shown to improve the correlation with in-situ measurements then it would become worthwhile to publish.
