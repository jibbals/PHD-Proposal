\subsubsection{Going Forward}

This work has been presented as a poster at the 7th international GEOS-Chem meeting (IGC7).
With improved model resolution (see section \ref{resolutionwork}) it is expected that dust emission accuracy will improve.
A comparison of simulations at different resolutions against both in situ and satellite measurements of AOD and dust concentrations across Australia should show an improvement in model estimations of these attributes.

An analysis of possible meteorological drivers of dust export will also be undertaken.

If improvements to the model can be shown to improve the correlation with in-situ measurements then it would become worthwhile to publish.
