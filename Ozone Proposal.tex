\subsection{Stratospheric Ozone transport analysis}
Working with doctors Simon Alexander and Robyn Schofield, I have analysed and filtered records of ozone profiles over Davis, Macquarie, and Melbourne to quantitatively determine instances of Stratosphere to Troposphere Transport events (STTs).

The vertical profiles of ozone volume mixing ratio are linearly interpolated to a regular grid with 20m resolution up to 14km altitude and are then bandpass filtered so as to retain perturbations on altitude scales between 0.5km - 5km. The choice of band limits is set empirically, but we note that to define an STT event, a clear increase above the background ozone level is needed, and a vertical limit of $\sim 5$~km removes seasonal-scale effects. 
The ozone perturbation profile is analysed at altitudes from 2~km above the surface (to avoid surface pollution events) and 1~km below the tropopause (to avoid the sharp transition to stratospheric air producing spurious false positives). Perturbations above the 99~th percentile (locally) of all ozone levels are initially classified as STT events.

Ozone profiles from 2004 until 2013 show clear STT influence on about 15\% of the days which are measured: with 36, 50, 73 events recorded from 240, 390, 456 ozonesonde profiles respectively for Davis, Melbourne, and Macquarie.
In addition to this STTs are shown to have seasonal cycles with more frequent occurrences in late summer at both Macquarie and Melbourne.
Actual ozone transported in is estimated conservatively and shows around a 3\% tropospheric ozone increase due to STTs with maximums at around 11\%.
This is done by integrating over the excess ozone concentration around the concentration peak which exceeds the event threshhold. 
I also break the STTs into altitude distributions and examine the behaviour of the tropopause according to the ozonesondes as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:sondeOzoneSeasons}

In order to look at the weather systems behind STTs I compare synoptic scale pressure data taken from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis data set (ERA-I).
STTs can often occur due to cut-off low and low front pressure systems and I've found two prime examples showing both of these weather patterns occuring on the same day as an ozonesonde records an STT.
One of these case studies involves a record breaking storm over Melbourne on the third of February 2005 and is shown in \ref{fig:MelbStormSonde}

This work will be useful in analysis and validation of the GEOS-Chem simulation of ozone over Australia and the near southern ocean, as clear vertical profiles over a long time period can be directly compared.
