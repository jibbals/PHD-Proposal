\subsection{Isoprene estimation and model validation over Australia}

\subsubsection{Preliminary Results}

Preliminary analysis has been performed on satellite HCHO data showing seasonal trends in Australian regions.
Additionally different satellite measurements and column totals have been intercompared.
SCIAMACHY suffers from poor measurements when south of 30$^{\circ}$S and is not reliable for our purposes, however GOME-2 records cover Australia sufficiently well for further analysis. 

An example of an intercomparison of Summer (Dec-Feb) HCHO measurements for three satellites can be seen in figure \ref{fig:intercomparehcho}.
