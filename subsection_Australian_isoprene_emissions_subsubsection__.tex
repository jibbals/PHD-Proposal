\subsection{Australian isoprene emissions}

\subsubsection{Preliminary Results}

Preliminary analysis has been performed on satellite HCHO data showing seasonal trends in Australian regions.
Additionally several satellite measurements and column totals have been intercompared.
SCIAMACHY suffers from poor measurement quality south of 30$^{\circ}$S and is not reliable for our purposes, however GOME-2 and OMI records cover Australia Completely. 

An example of an intercomparison of Summer (Dec-Feb) HCHO measurements for three satellites can be seen in figure \ref{fig:intercomparehcho}.

Finally a preliminary comparison of the FTIR spectrometer retrieval with a GEOS-Chem modelled column of HCHO through the use of averaging kernal de-convolution is completed.
