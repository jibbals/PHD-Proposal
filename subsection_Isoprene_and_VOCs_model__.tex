\subsection{Isoprene and VOCs model validation over Australia}
Another source(the main source) of ozone in the lower troposphere is chemical formation following emissions of precursor gases, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene, and nitrogen oxides (NOx).
Globally the main sources for NOx include fossil fuel combustion ($\sim$50\%), biomass burning ($\sim$20\%), lightning, and microbial activity in soils \citep{Delmas_1997}.
Estimates using a global CTM (CHASER) constrained by measurments from two satellites as well as the in-situ measurements taken through LIDAR and aircraft (INTEX-B) put global tropospheric NOx emissions at 45.4 TgN yr$^{-1}$ \cite{Miyazaki_2011}. 
Estimates put isoprene emission at roughly 550 Tg/yr \cite{Guenther_2006, Monks_2014}, emitted globally mostly by trees and shrubs during the day.

In Australia, biogenic ozone precursor sources are highly uncertain, impeding accurate ozone modelling and projections. These uncertainties could explain why models of formaldehyde (HCHO) over Australia are not good at reproducing observed data \cite{Stavrakou_2009}. Atmospheric HCHO data exists over Wollongong, and some campaigns have taken place elsewhere in Australia, however these do not give a full overview of the continent's emissions. Satellite-based observations do exist with good coverage but these have large uncertainties. 

Determination of purely biogenic emissions from satellite-based observations is possible by filtering out biomass burnings using the fire counts and aerosol absorption optical depth(AAOD). The AATSR, Aqua, and Terra satellites have fire counts which can be used, and the EOS Aura satellite contains the AAOD measurements. These data can effectively filter satellite HCHO measurements in order to compare with biogenic models and this process has been implemented already in a similar way over South Africa \cite{Marais_2012}.

HCHO is an intermediate chemical product and can be used as a proxy for determining biogenic isoprene emissions. 
Isoprene is commonly measured by proxy through satellite HCHO vertical column densities (VCDs). HCHO, once filtered for fire plumes and anthropogenic influences, can determine isoprene emission through the use of a chemical transport model (CTM).
This method of inference has been used successfully in several countries including North America\cite{Palmer_2003}, South America\cite{Barkley_2013}, and Africa \cite{Marais_2012}.

Satellite HCHO measurements exist since 2004 (OMI) and 2006 (GOME2), and the ground based measurements over Wollongong exist since 1996. While the ground based data is spatially sparse it can be used as validation of models and satellite data. Combining the long record of measurements from Wollongong with the decadal-scale satellite data and chemical transport modelling in this PhD project will allow the first large-scale quantification of isoprene measurements in Australia, paving the way for more accurate ozone projections.
