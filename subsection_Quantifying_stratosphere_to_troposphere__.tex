\subsection{Quantifying stratosphere to troposphere ozone intrusions}
When looking at a vertical profile of ozone the effect of STT is clear, with the right filter we can quantitatively observe and characterise STTs.
Using a Fourier filter on the ozonesonde profiles will give us the first southern hemispheric analysis of STTs.
