\section{Dust Summary}

The Australian dust story is one of extremes, convolving the ENSO cycle with flooding, droughts, and winds. Fluvial deposits in the Eyre basin are required to provide a dust base, which will only have mobility during suitable dry weather conditions, which can only be saltated and transported by large winds(todo cites).

Synoptic scale measurements of dust plumes in Australia are kept by the BoM and can be used to estimate dust transport caused by large storms(\cite{Leys_2011}, todo more cites here). These estimates exemplify the large variability in Australian annual dust transport with single storms moving between X and Y Mt of dust in a single day, a significant portion of the yearly mean (millions of cites here).
