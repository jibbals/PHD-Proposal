\subsection{Red Dawn: \cite{Leys_2011}}
PM10 concentrations and mass transport during "Red Dawn" - Sydney 23 September 2009.

Worst dust storm to hit Sydney since records began in 1940, with heavy dust for nine hours and visibility reduced to 400m at the airport.
Storms are common in the arid inland but rare on the east coast.
Plume dust concentration generally calculated either by simulation, or by plume volume * aerosol concentration.
$$M = AhC$$ 
where A is plume area, h is plume height, C is g/m3 of dust, M is dust load in grams.
These measurements are hampered by coarse temporal resolution of at best three hourly intervals of the Bureau of Meteorology(BoM)'s synoptic visibility observations.

Dust concentrations sourced from some stations of the DECCW AQMN.

Visibility is used to estimate total suspended particle(TSP) concentration, here a conservative predictor of PM10 c for given V is used from (Zhangbei TODO CITE).

PM10 dust transport is defined and measured with plume dust concentrations measured at various altitudes with a kite. 

Dust storm preceded by 9 dry years, 13 hot years, and was itself the hottest year on record.

PM10 normally $10{\mu}g/m^3$ in Sydney peaked at $15366{\mu}g/m^3$.
\~2.54 Mt of PM10 dust transported off shore.
Storm on par with large Chinese dust storm.
Dust ceiling around 2500m, up to 3000m.


\subsection{Oceanic Deposition \cite{Grand_2015}}
Dust deposition in the eastern Indian Ocean: The ocean perspective from Antarctica to the Bay of Bengal.

Upper ocean distribution of dissolved Fe and Al in the eastern Indian ocean along a $95^{\circ}$E meridional transect.
Using dissolved Al measured from the CLIVAR-CO\_{2} program is used with a simple steady state model to produce estimates of total dust deposition. This assumes many things including that the surface water concentrations of elements are in a steady state to balance out scavenging, which allows the estimate of deposition required to maintain the steady state.

Some Results:
Minimum dust flux at Southern Ocean : 66$\pm$60 mg m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, 
Maximums for south Indian subtropical gyre: 940 mg m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ (at 18S),
southern Bay of Bengal: 2500$\pm$570 mg m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$.
