\subsection{Aims}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To determine the impact and causes of stratosphere to troposphere ozone transport (STT) using ozonesones and ECMWF weather reanalysis data. Work on this aim is almost complete, hopefully I can submit a paper to ACP as first author in early 2016.
\item To quantify Australian isoprene emissions using satellite data and the GEOS-Chem model. This will be commenced soon.
\item To attribute Australian ozone influence from isoprene, and STT sources over particular sites using in-situ data and model output.
\item To improve the GEOS-Chem model by allowing increased resolution over Australia.
\item To quantify Australia's dust emissions and transport modelled by GEOS-Chem and validate against in-situ and remote sensing data.
\end{enumerate}
