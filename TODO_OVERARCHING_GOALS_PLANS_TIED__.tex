TIED TO biogenic importance in intro(also a TODO))

\subsection{Aims}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ozone profile analysis determining impact and causes of stratosphere to tropopause ozone transport (STT) using ozonesones and ECMWF weather reanalysis data.
\item Australian isoprene analysis, and validation of the GEOS-Chem model of isoprene using satellite records and in-situ measurements. 
Tropospheric ozone influence from isoprene and NOx to be compared against the STT influence over particular sites. 
\item GEOS-Chem resolution improvement over Australia, using a nested grid within the global model to allow high resolution output without severely impacting run time.
\item Australian dust analysis examining the accuracy of GEOS-Chem's dust simulation compared to in-situ data from CoDii and AERONET sites and determining the impact on southern ocean dust deposition.
\end{enumerate}
