\subsection{Satellites}

Several satellites provide long term trace gas data with near complete global coverage, including GOME (1, 2 metop A, and 2 metop B), OMI AURA, and SCIAMACHY.
These satellites are on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) trajectories and overpass any area up to once per day. 
They record near nadir reflected spectra between around 250-700~nm split into spectral components at around $0.3$~nm in order to calculate trace gases including O$_3$, NO$_2$, BrO, SO$_2$, and HCHO.
An example for the GOME-2A satellite is given in figure \ref{fig:gomeproducts}.
