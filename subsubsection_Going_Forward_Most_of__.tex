\subsubsection{Going Forward}

Most of the analysis for this work has been completed and a draft paper is awaiting further input from co-authors before being published to ACP.

This work will also be useful in extra analysis and validation of the GEOS-Chem simulation of ozone over Australia and the near southern ocean, as clear vertical profiles over a long time period can be directly compared.
